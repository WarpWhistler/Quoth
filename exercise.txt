There are 1011 stars in the galaxy. That used to be a huge number. But it's only a hundred billion. It's less than the national deficit! We used to call them astronomical numbers. Now we should call them economical numbers. 
    - Richard Feynman

For all our conceits about being the center of the universe, we live in a routine planet of a humdrum star stuck away in an obscure corner ... on an unexceptional galaxy which is one of about 100 billion galaxies. ... That is the fundamental fact of the universe we inhabit, and it is very good for us to understand that. 
    - Carl Sagan

Far out in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the Western Spiral arm of the Galaxy lies a small unregarded yellow sun.

    - Andy Rooney

As soon as we started programming, we found out to our surprise that it wasn't as easy to get programs right as we had thought. Debugging had to be discovered. I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs. 
    - Maurice Wilkes

Only wimps use tape backup: real men just upload their important stuff on ftp, and let the rest of the world mirror it.

I don't paint things. I only paint the difference between things.

Mathematicians do not study objects, but relations among objects; they are indifferent to the replacement of objects by others as long the relations don't change. Matter is not important, only form interests them.

Science is like sex: sometimes something useful comes out, but that is not the reason we are doing it 
    - Richard Feynman

Literature is mostly about having sex, and not much about having babies; life is the other way round. 
    - David Lodge

More than any other time in history mankind faces a crossroads. One path leads to despair and utter hopelessness, the other to total extinction. Let us pray we have the wisdom to choose correctly.

When I face an issue of great import that cleaves both constituents and colleagues, I always take the same approach. I engage in deep deliberation and quiet contemplation.

    - Sen. Everett Dirksen

Wise men make proverbs, but fools repeat them.
